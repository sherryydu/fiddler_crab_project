**Description of the data: Du_FiddlerCrabProject_Data-raw_V0.csv**

This file contains 9 variables and 392 observations to fiddler crabs from 13 marshes across the Atlantic coastal USA in July - August 2016. This data has been cleaned, but not been analyzed.

**Variable descriptions:**

* *date:* date (ISO standard: YYYY-MM-DD) describing the time of collection of each crab.

* *latitude:* continuous numeric value describing the location of each sampled crab (degree).

* *site:* categorical variable of the acronym of the research site of where each crab was sampled; (abbreviation of site name); GTM=Guana Tolomoto Matanzas NERR | SI=Sapelo Island NERR |NIB=North Inlet Winyah Bay NERR | ZI=Zeke's Island NERR | RC=Rachel Carson NERR | VCR=Virginia Coastal Reserve LTER | DB=Delaware Bay NERR |JC=Jacques Cousteau NERR | CT=Sixpenny Island - Connecticut |NB=Narragansett Bay NERR | CC=Cape Cod | BC=Bare Cove Park | PIE=Plum Island Estuary - West Creek.

* *size:* continuous numeric value showing the carapace width of each crab (millimeter).

* *air_temp:* continuous numeric value showing the mean annual air temperature (degrees Celsius).

* *air_temp_sd:* continuous numeric value showing the standard deviation of the mean annual air temperature (degrees Celsius).

* *water_temp:* continuous numeric value showing the mean annual water temperature degrees Celsius), water temperature was collected at the surface (i.e., <1 meter).

* *water_temp_sd:* continuous numeric value showing the standard deviation of the mean annual water temperature (degrees Celsius).
